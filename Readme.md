# Intelligent Robot Interaction Lab 

# 北邮智能机器人交互实验仿真作业



## Run：

* After you start the simulation, you should to press the spacebar twice to enter the gait mode.
* And then you could press "G" to enter the navigation system
* Press 1,2,3,4,5,6 to change the target.

If you are lucky, the robot will move rightly! :laughing:



## Codes Include:

* Basic Point2Point 
* A simple obstacle aviodance algorithm similar to the Bug0
* A simple PathPlan algorithm
* A simple hand raising case by controling the servo directly



## NOTES:

* These codes based on the open-source robot examples for OP2 in **webots R2023a** 
* ***Please Use The Same Version Of Webots !!***
* You could find the main code in "robot_webots_work\robotis\darwin-op\controllers\walk "
